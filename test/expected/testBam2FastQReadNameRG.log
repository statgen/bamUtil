Paired Read, 1 but couldn't find mate, so writing as unpaired (single-ended)
Bam2FastQ: OQ tag was not found/invalid, so using the quality field in records without the tag
Paired Read, 7 but couldn't find mate, so writing as unpaired (single-ended)

Found 14 read pairs.
Found 0 unpaired reads.
Failed to find mates for 2 reads, so they were written as unpaired
  (not included in either of the above counts).
28 records did not have tag OQ or it was invalid, so the quality field was used for those records.
